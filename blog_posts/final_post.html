            <h2>How Would I Design The Course?</h2>
            <p>Personally, I feel that the first 2 sections of this course are structured very well, and would mimic the
                style from this semester. The textbook works well with how labs are assigned and functioned. I also felt
                that the course and Dr. Stewart's teaching style worked well, especially for the scope of the labs and
                projects of the first two sections.</p>
            <p>Where I'd have to offer changes would be in the final section of the course. While I felt that Professor
                Johnson's textbook was probably one of the best ways to have learned the material for projects 1 and 2,
                I had a lot of difficulty in the later sections. Granted, I had a number of personal factors which did
                not help, but using the textbook as a primary and introductory resource was troublesome for me, in part
                due to the informal, sort of "learn as you go" mentality. Dr. Stewart as an in-class resource was
                immensely helpful throughout the year, mostly due to his ability to fill in any gaps I had from the
                textbook.</p>
            <p>A feature of this class I found incredibly helpful and motivating (in a sense?), was the peer
                collaboration. This was the first time I had the opportunity to work on full projects in a duo at JMU,
                and I found it to be a very fun way to learn web dev.</p>
            <p>While I wish I had stayed on top of assignments more this semester, thank you Dr. Stewart for being one
                of the most understanding and welcoming professors I've had at JMU.</p>
